## Ta Allocation

**Methods**: Creating a Web App that is easy to use, reliable, and accounts for security concerns.

**Purpose**: Applying the formula by hand is an extremely cumbersome, error prone process that takes time to execute which can result in unfair allocations. 

**Implications**: If Teaching Assistants (TA) are allocated unfairly Professors may gain more  funding for Teaching Assistant positions compared to other professors over a period of semesters instead of applying for external funding to support their teaching assistants. 

R**Results**: By implementing a system that the TA selection committee can use which is also user friendly and reliable, the Computer Science & Engineering Department at UC Merced can make fair, equitable, and transparent assignments for Teaching Assistant positions.
